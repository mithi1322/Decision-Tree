    "# Answer 1:\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes how to update the probability of an event based on new evidence or information.\n",
    "# Answer 2:\n",
    "The formula for Bayes' theorem is:\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) is the conditional probability of event A given event B.\n",
    "P(B|A) is the conditional probability of event B given event A.\n",
    "P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B, respectively.\n",
    "# Answer 3:\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is used in practice for various purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference: Updating beliefs or probabilities based on new evidence or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning: Naive Bayes classifiers use Bayes' theorem to make predictions based on observed features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam filtering: Bayes' theorem can be applied to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical diagnosis: Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a disease given certain symptoms or test results.\n",
    "# Answer 4:\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is closely related to conditional probability. It provides a way to calculate the conditional probability of an event A given event B by incorporating prior knowledge (P(A)) and the likelihood of observing event B given event A (P(B|A)).\n",
    "# Answer 5:\n",
    "The choice of which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use depends on the nature of the features and the assumptions made about their distributions. The three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes that continuous features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes: Suitable for discrete features that represent counts or frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Designed for binary features that represent presence or absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of classifier depends on the nature of the data and the assumptions that align with the problem at hand. For example, if the features are continuous and roughly follow a normal distribution, Gaussian Naive Bayes may be appropriate. If the features are discrete and represent counts or frequencies, Multinomial Naive Bayes may be a better choice.\n",
    "# Answer 6:\n",
    "To predict the class of the new instance using Naive Bayes, we need to calculate the conditional probabilities for each class and select the class with the highest probability.\n",

    "P(X1=3|B) = 1 / 9\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X2=4|B) = 3 / 9\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming equal prior probabilities for each class (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:\n",

    "\n",
    "To determine the class of the new instance, we compare the posterior probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|X1=3, X2=4) = (4/13) * (3/13) * 0.5 / P(X1=3, X2=4)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|X1=3, X2=4) = (1/9) * (3/9) * 0.5 / P(X1=3, X2=4)\n",
