    "In this situation, the best regression metric to employ would be the Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual house prices. It provides a measure of the average squared deviation of the predicted prices from the actual prices. Since house prices are typically continuous variables, MSE is a suitable metric to assess the accuracy and performance of the SVM regression model."

    "If the goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, the most appropriate evaluation metric would be the Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual house prices. It provides a direct measure of the accuracy of the predictions by penalizing large deviations between the predicted and actual prices. R-squared, on the other hand, measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. While R-squared is useful for assessing the goodness of fit, MSE provides a more direct measure of the prediction accuracy.\n"

    "When dealing with a dataset that contains a significant number of outliers, it is recommended to use evaluation metrics that are robust to outliers. One such metric is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). MAE calculates the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values, disregarding the sign of the differences. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to other metrics like MSE or RMSE, as it does not square the differences. Therefore, MAE would be the most appropriate metric to use in this scenario.\n"

    "# Answer 4:\n",
    "When both the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values are very close, it is generally recommended to use RMSE as the evaluation metric. RMSE is derived from MSE by taking the square root of the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values. The main advantage of RMSE over MSE is that it is in the same unit as the target variable, which makes it more interpretable. RMSE represents the average magnitude of the prediction errors in the original scale of the target variable, whereas MSE is in squared units. Therefore, RMSE would be the preferred metric to use in this case.\n"

    "If the goal is to measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable, the most appropriate evaluation metric would be the R-squared (coefficient of determination). R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It provides an indication of how well the model captures the variability in the target variable. R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance, and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variance. Therefore, R-squared would be the preferred metric to use in this scenario to assess the explanatory power of the different SVM regression models with different kernels."
