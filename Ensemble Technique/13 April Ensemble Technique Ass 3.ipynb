    "# Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "# Answer 1:\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It is based on the Random Forest algorithm, which combines multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate regression model. Each decision tree in the Random Forest Regressor is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions of all individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "# Answer 2:\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through two main mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging): By training each decision tree on a different bootstrap sample of the training data, Random Forest introduces diversity among the trees. This variation helps reduce the chances of the model memorizing noise in the data and improves its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Randomness: Random Forest Regressor selects a random subset of features at each split during the construction of each tree. This feature randomness ensures that no single feature dominates the decision-making process, preventing overfitting to specific features.\n",
    "# Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "# Answer 3:\n",
    "In Random Forest Regressor, the predictions of multiple decision trees are aggregated to obtain the final prediction. For regression tasks, the predictions of individual trees are averaged to form the ensemble prediction. The average helps to smooth out the noise and produce a more stable and accurate prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "# Answer 4:\n",
    "Some of the key hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor are:\n",
    "\n",
    "n_estimators: The number of decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_depth: The maximum depth of each decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "\n",
    "bootstrap: Whether to use bootstrap samples when building trees.\n",
    "# Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "# Answer 5:\n",
    "The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor lies in the ensemble approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor: It is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to make a final prediction. The randomness introduced during the training process and the averaging of predictions improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree Regressor: It is a single decision tree model that may have high variance and is prone to overfitting, especially when the tree is deep and captures noise in the data.\n",
    "# Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "# Answer 6:\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced overfitting: Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting compared to individual decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness: It works well with noisy and large datasets, and the ensemble approach makes it more robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "High accuracy: Random Forest Regressor often provides accurate predictions, even for complex regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: The ensemble of multiple decision trees increases the computational complexity and memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability: Random Forest models are less interpretable compared to single decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning: Tuning the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor can be time-consuming.\n",
    "# Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "# Answer 7:\n",
    "The output of Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numerical value. For each input instance, the model predicts a real-valued output, making it suitable for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "# Answer 8:\n",
    "No, Random Forest Regressor is specifically designed for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict continuous numerical values. For classification tasks, the corresponding ensemble method is called \"Random Forest Classifier,\" which is used to predict discrete class labels."
